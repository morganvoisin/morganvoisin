hey everyone, thank you for stopping by and reading this <3 i know i should be using it as a bio thing, but lets just use this secret little place to send you messages. i hope 2024 will treat you right, that you're safe and taken care of, and that some things make you feel soft and tender and all happy and warm inside. i hope you heal from the things you don't talk about, that all this tech stuff can be more than just a "career", but also a part of your identity that helps you get through all the hard times. we're all people living together in this complicated experience thing called life.

be creative, work hard, and most importantly love yourself. <3
